Create a database
The following tables form part of a database held in a relational DBMS: Hotel (HotelNo, Name, City) HotelNo is primary key
Room (RoomNo, HotelNo, Type, Price)
Booking (HotelNo, GuestNo, DateFrom, DateTo, RoomNo)
Guest (GuestNo, GuestName, GuestAddress) GuestNo is primary key

Solve Queries by SQL
1.	What is the total revenue per night from all double rooms?
SELECT SUM(Price) FROM Room WHERE Type = 'Double';

2.	List the details of all rooms at the Grosvenor Hotel, including the name of the guest staying in the room, if the room is occupied.
SELECT r.RoomNo, r.Type, r.Price, g.GuestName
FROM Room r
LEFT JOIN Booking b ON r.RoomNo = b.RoomNo
LEFT JOIN Guest g ON b.GuestNo = g.GuestNo
WHERE r.HotelNo = 1;

3.	What is the average number of bookings for each hotel in April?
SELECT h.HotelNo, AVG(COUNT(b.RoomNo)) AS AvgBookings
FROM Hotel h
LEFT JOIN Booking b ON h.HotelNo = b.HotelNo
WHERE MONTH(b.DateFrom) = 4
GROUP BY h.HotelNo;

4.	Create index on one of the field and show is performance in query.
-- Creating an index on Room table's HotelNo column
CREATE INDEX idx_HotelNo ON Room(HotelNo);
-- You can observe the performance improvement in subsequent queries involving the Room table and HotelNo column.

SELECT * FROM Hotel;

6.	List full details of all hotels in London.
SELECT * FROM Hotel WHERE City = 'London';

7.	Update the price of all rooms by 5%.
UPDATE Room SET Price = Price * 1.05;

8.	List the number of rooms in each hotel in London.
SELECT h.HotelNo, h.Name, COUNT(r.RoomNo) AS NumRooms
FROM Hotel h
LEFT JOIN Room r ON h.HotelNo = r.HotelNo
WHERE h.City = 'London'
GROUP BY h.HotelNo, h.Name;

9.	List all double or family rooms with a price below Â£40.00 per night, in ascending order of price.
